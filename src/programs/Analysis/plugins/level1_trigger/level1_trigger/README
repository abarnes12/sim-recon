10/24/2012 Update  D. Lawrence

This is now deprecated as the code has been moved into
a standard library in DANA (TRIGGER). The object names
were changed from DTrigger to DMCTrigger.

This plugin will provide a factory that produces DTrigger objects
that contain a flag indicating whether the level 1 trigger *would*
have fired for the event based on the raw data in the event.

This is for use with Simulated Data only.
