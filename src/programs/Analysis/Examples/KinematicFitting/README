README for Kinematic Fitting examples

Nov. 24, 2009  David Lawrence

This directory contains example code for using the CMU kinematic
fitter contained in the Hall-D repository. These examples were
written by Matt Bellis over a year ago. They were tarred up and
posted to the wiki (http://www.jlab.org/Hall-D/software/wiki/index.php/Image:Testkfit.tgz)
by Curtis Meyer on Nov. 24, 2009.

I am placing this code in the repository to make it more easily
accessible by the collaboration at large and allow modifications
to be made to it that can easily be published through subversion.

At this time I have not tested these myself no do I know of anyone
else running them other than Matt back when he originally authored
them.
