	\section intro Introduction

	The Hall-D reconstruction software is built upon the C++ <A href="http://www.jlab.org/JANA">JANA</A>
	framework. The JANA framework was designed for Hall-D but is maintained separately as an
	independent project and contains no Hall-D specific source code. The Hall-D specific reconstruction
	software based on JANA is often referred to as <i>DANA</i>.
	
	In broad terms, the JANA framework distinguishes between data classes and algorithm classes.
	Data classes generally have data members with no more than trivial methods defined. The algorithm
	classes are where the real work is done. These classes are called <i>factories</i> in JANA.
	The framework itself is repsonsible for passing pointers to the data objects between the factories
	that make them.
	
	For example, a factory that makes calorimeter cluster objects does so by using calorimeter
	hit objects as inputs. The cluster making factory requests the hit objects from the JANA framework
	whose job is to locate them and return their pointers.
	
	This design provides a loose coupling between the factory classes. The
	factory needing a type of data object as input doesn't need direct knowledge of the factory that
	actually generates those objects. Furthermore, multiple factory classes can exist that
	implement different algorithms, but deliver the same type of data objects. Which exact algorithm
	that is used can be specified by the user at run time rather than at compile time.
	
	The naming convention used for classes is to have the factory class name be the name of the data
	class of the objects it provides, but with "_factory" appended. For example, the algorithm that
	produces DBCALCluster objects would be named DBCALCluster_factory. If an alternate algorithm
	exists that produces the same type of data objects, it will be "tagged" and the tag appended
	to the end of the name (e.g. DBCALCluster_factory_HOUGH). All Hall-D specific classes start
	with the letter "D". (JANA classes start with "J").
	
	Below is a thumbnail of the call graph between factories implemented in DANA. For practical
	reasons, only the names of the data classes are shown. Click on it to get
	a larger picture where individual classes can be clicked to jump to the corresponding 
	factory page. In the image, the "first" request comes at the top from the JEventProcessor object asking
	for DPhysicsEvent objects. The DPhysicsEvent algorithm requires DParticleSet as (its only) input as
	shown by the arrows. Eventually, requests lead back to data from the input file which are the classes shown
	in green trapazoids at the bottom of the graph.

	It should be noted that not all classes in the Hall-D reconstruction software show up in this
	call graph. Deprecated classes and alternate algorithms that aren't part of the default
	reconstruction as well as utility classes that aren't passed through the framework won't
	show up here. The plot itself is generated automatically by JANA using the <i>janadot</i>
	plugin and specifying only the defaults be used.
	

	\section legend Using This Site
	
	Not all code in the repository is considered part of the core reconstruction/simulation 
	software for Hall-D. As software development is continuous, some code will naturally be replaced
	with newer code that implements different algorithms. Alternatively, some code will exist
	purely to aid in debugging or to understand certain aspects of the data, but will not be
	used for production level processing. As such, classes may fall into one or more categories.
	Which categories the class belongs in may be very useful for someone browsing through this
	documentation. The following icons are used to provide quick visual cues to flag classes that
	you probably don't want to spend a lot of time understanding. These are described in the 
	table below.
